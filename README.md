# Customer Churn Analysis Dasboard
## Project Objective :
This project centers on churn analysis for a telecom company, examining techniques, tools, and proven strategies to reduce customer attrition and boost loyalty, turning raw data into practical insights for long-term growth.
### Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:<br>
‚Ä¢	SSMS - For ETL processes and to design, query, manage, and maintain SQL Server databases for development and data analysis.<br>
‚Ä¢	üìä Power BI Desktop ‚Äì Main data visualization platform used for report creation.<br>
‚Ä¢	üìÇ Power Query ‚Äì Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.<br>
‚Ä¢	üß† DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) ‚Äì Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.<br>
‚Ä¢	üìù Data Modeling ‚Äì Relationships established among tables (resorts, snow, and data_dictionary) to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.<br>
‚Ä¢	üìÅ File Format ‚Äì .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.
## Project Targets
Develop a complete ETL workflow within a database and build a Power BI dashboard to leverage customer data for the following objectives:
- Visualize & Analyse Customer Data at below levels
- Demographic
- Geographic
- Payment & Account Info
- Services
- Study Churner Profile & Identify Areas for Implementing Marketing Campaigns
## Metrics Required
- Total Customers
- Total Churn & Churn Rate
- New Joiners
  
# Step 1 :  
The first step in churn analysis is to load data from the source file. We will use Microsoft SQL Server, as it efficiently handles recurring data loads and ensures data integrity, unlike Excel.
```sql
-- Create Database
CREATE DATABASE db_Churn
--Data Exploration - Check Distinct Values
SELECT Gender, Count(Gender) as TotalCount,
Count(Gender)  1.0 / (Select Count() from stg_Churn)  as Percentage
from stg_Churn
Group by Gender
--
SELECT Contract, Count(Contract) as TotalCount,
Count(Contract)  1.0 / (Select Count() from stg_Churn)  as Percentage
from stg_Churn
Group by Contract
--
SELECT Customer_Status, Count(Customer_Status) as TotalCount, Sum(Total_Revenue) as TotalRev,
Sum(Total_Revenue) / (Select sum(Total_Revenue) from stg_Churn) * 100  as RevPercentage
from stg_Churn
Group by Customer_Status
--
SELECT State, Count(State) as TotalCount,
Count(State)  1.0 / (Select Count() from stg_Churn)  as Percentage
from stg_Churn
Group by State
Order by Percentage desc
